# BootstrapChallenge

BUilding a portfolio page with bootstrap 4
It has a navigation bar and uses nav code from Bootstrap.
I have added a hero section with information about me, a work section with cards detailing my current and future projects, a skills section, a contact me part with a link to my github and a footer with a button.
